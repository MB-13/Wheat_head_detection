# Wheat Head Detection Using Faster R-CNN

This repository contains a solution for detecting wheat heads in images using Faster R-CNN, a popular object detection model. The project involves training a Faster R-CNN model to accurately identify and localize wheat heads in images.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- Instructions for training and evaluating the Faster R-CNN model for wheat head detection.
- Code for preprocessing data, training the model, and evaluating results.
- Example images demonstrating the model's performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wheat-head-detection-faster-rcnn.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd wheat-head-detection-faster-rcnn
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Preparation

1. **Dataset**: You will need a dataset of images with annotations for wheat heads. Ensure that your dataset is in a suitable format for Faster R-CNN (e.g., COCO format or custom annotations converted accordingly).
   
2. **Data Directory**: Place your dataset in the `data/` directory, or update the paths in the code to point to your dataset location.

### Training the Model

To train the Faster R-CNN model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py --data-dir data/ --output-dir output/
```
This command will start the training process and save the trained model in the `output/` directory.

### Evaluating the Model

After training, evaluate the model with:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model-path output/model.pth --data-dir data/
```
This will provide evaluation metrics and save the evaluation results.

## Results

Below are example results showing the wheat head detection performance of the model. Each image demonstrates the model's ability to accurately detect and localize wheat heads in different scenarios.

### Example Results

1. **Result Image 1**
   ![Result Image 1](path/to/your/result1.jpg)

2. **Result Image 2**
   ![Result Image 2](path/to/your/result2.jpg)

3. **Result Image 3**
   ![Result Image 3](path/to/your/result3.jpg)

Replace the `path/to/your/resultX.jpg` with the actual paths to your result images.
