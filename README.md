## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Faster R-CNN for wheat head detection. Key aspects of the project include:

- **Model Training**: Training a Faster R-CNN model to detect wheat heads in images.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance based on validation loss and detection accuracy.
- **Results**: Visual examples of the model's performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wheat-head-detection-faster-rcnn.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd wheat-head-detection-faster-rcnn
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Data Preparation

1. **Dataset**: Obtain a dataset of images with annotations for wheat heads. Ensure the dataset is in a suitable format for Faster R-CNN (e.g., COCO format or custom annotations).
   
2. **Data Directory**: Place your dataset in the `data/` directory, or update the paths in the code to point to your dataset location.

## Training and Evaluation

### Training the Model

To train the Faster R-CNN model, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py --data-dir data/ --output-dir output/
```
This command will start the training process and save the trained model in the `output/` directory. After 5 epochs, the model achieved a validation loss of 0.7.

### Evaluating the Model

After training, evaluate the model with:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model-path output/model.pth --data-dir data/
```
This will provide evaluation metrics and save the evaluation results.

## Results

Below are example results showing the wheat head detection performance of the model. Each image demonstrates the model's ability to accurately detect and localize wheat heads in different scenarios.

### Example Results
